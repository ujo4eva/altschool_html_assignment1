    </p>
    <p><strong>Why I joined: </strong>I'd been reading Hacksultan's Not The Boring Tech Stuff
                                        newsletter for a while, and between that and X, Altschool
                                        curiousity seeds had been sown from time immemorial. (Sure
                                        took their time to germinate, that's for sure).
                                        <br>
                                        I joined AltSchool initially hoping there was some kind of
                                        systems/low-level programming course, as I was looking for
                                        what is essentially an extremely relevant extracurricular certificate 
                                        to pad my CV with at the end of my University program.
                                        <br>
                                        I literally signed up for the Cloud Engineering track with the mindset
                                        of "<i>BLEEP</i>-it, we ball, no knowledge is a waste anyway, let me
                                        go for the one that seems the most interesting."
    </p>
    <p><strong>My Goals: </strong>I want to build good projects and get work, either full/part-time remote or 
                                    freelance and start earning BEFORE I graduate University. I think that's
                                    very possible to achieve within the next 2.5 years.
